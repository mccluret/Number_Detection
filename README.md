# Number_Detection
##Match pixel arrays to dataset and return the number in the image.

(Lessons with Sentdex)

My introduction to numpy and matplotlib by storing image array datasets and comparing the test image to determine the number.  
Many flaws, as shown in the example, but will work if drawn fully in the 8x8 cell.   
TODO: find edges of number to center and improve detection.  
  
These numbers turned out great when drawing the number in the full 8x8 image.
